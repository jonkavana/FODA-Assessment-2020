# FODA-Assessment-2020
Assessment work for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Course - GMIT 2020


# Overview of the Course Assessment
There is going to be four parts to this assessment, each one uploaded throughout the course of the module. 


# User Requirements
Each user needs to have the following available to them in order to progress from start to finish for this exercise. 

## Material
1) Laptptop needs to be available at all times. 
2) werweffsdf


## Part 1 - Counts

As detailed in the upload on October 5th 2020:
Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.

Addendum via Moodle: with Python, anything built-in that can be used without an import statement can be used.

### Breakdown of the task
Create a function called counts.
Needs to be the end user who inputs the data.
This will then need to be returned a dictionary of 'unique items as keys' - needs a better understanding of this, perhaps context dependent.
Output of this list needs to be counted, as per the example.
