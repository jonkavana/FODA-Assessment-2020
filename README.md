## Part 1 - Counts

As detailed in the upload on October 5th 2020:
Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.

Addendum via Moodle: with Python, anything built-in that can be used without an import statement can be used.
