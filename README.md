# FODA-Assessment-2020
Assessment work for the Fundamentals of Data Analysis Course - GMIT 2020


# Overview of the Course Assessment
There is going to be four parts to this assessment, each one uploaded throughout the course of the module. 


# User Requirements
Each user needs to have the following available to them in order to progress from start to finish for this exercise. 

## Material
1) Laptptop needs to be available at all times. 
2) Python needs to be installed on the laptop
3) Standard Python Library to be used
4) Aceess to and understanding of Jupyter Notebook


## Part 1 - Counts

As detailed in the upload on October 5th 2020:
Write a Python function called counts that takes a list as input and returns a dictionary of unique items in the list as keys and the number of times each item appears as values. So, the input ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C', 'A'] should have output {'A': 3, 'B': 1, 'C': 1} . Your code should not depend on any module from the standard library1 or otherwise. You should research the task first and include a description with references of your algorithm in the notebook.

Addendum via Moodle: with Python, anything built-in that can be used without an import statement can be used.

### Breakdown of the task
Create a function called counts.
Needs to be the end user who inputs the data.
This will then need to be returned a dictionary of 'unique items as keys' - needs a better understanding of this, perhaps context dependent.
Assumption: i think this means take the data that is input and do with it as you see fit i.e., count the number of times a letter is produced.
Output of this list needs to be counted, as per the example.
